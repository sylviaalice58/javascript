// in java script we need to have an initializer before declaring a variable. We can use var, let, or const to declare a variable.In E56 we have  two main types of initializers: 

// let: It declares values which can be changed later on. 
// Hoisting

let weight = 10.5
console.log(weight)

// const: It declares values which cannot be changed later on and entire program

const pi = 3.142
console.log("The value of pi is: ", pi)
